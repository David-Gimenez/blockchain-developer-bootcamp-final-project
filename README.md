# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

This is my final project repository for ConsenSys Academy 2021 Blockchain Developer Bootcamp to obtain the certification of Blockchain Developer.

The objective of this project is to create a platform based on Blockchain technology, which allows graduates of educational institutions to digitally validate the degrees obtained with the support of the issuing educational institution and to allow educational institutions to issue certified degrees backed by Blockchain technology.

The degree could be consulted electronically in the blockchain by third parties, with total confidence from anywhere in the world and with the same validity as the degree in paper.

The project will consist in the creation of a set of Smart Contracts and a web application that allows the validation of academic degrees in a safe, transparent and efficient way.

Using a distributed database system based on Blockchain technology, asymmetric cryptography and hash functions, thus allowing unequivocally identifying the intervening parties, as well as storing information safely to be consulted by third parties.
